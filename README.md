## How to Download All EBooks

1. Download the zip file and extract its content to a folder of your choice.
2. Run the BookDownloader.exe program.
3. It will download all the books and their related files to your computer's  c:\temp\books folder.
4. Fetching all the files will take some time, so let it run until you see "All files downloaded" message in the console window.
